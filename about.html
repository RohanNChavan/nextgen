        We’re building a modern, responsible, and user-friendly way to begin your loan application.
      </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In India, loans have become an important tool to support day-to-day financial needs — whether for emergency medical expenses,
          education fees, family events, debt consolidation, or home improvements. However, the process of applying for a loan often
          feels stressful due to unclear eligibility rules, confusing forms, and repeated documentation requests.
        </p>

        <p>
          NextGen Finance was created with one simple goal: <b>make loan applications easier and more user-friendly</b>.
          We focus on a smooth online form and structured information collection so customers can take the first step with confidence.

            We avoid collecting unnecessary details.

        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <p>
          The information submitted in our application form is used primarily for:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Understanding the loan requirement and basic eligibility</li>
          <li>Contacting the customer within 24 hours for next steps</li>
          <li>Assisting with documentation and verification flow</li>

          If you wish to stop communication, you can request opt-out during the call.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          NextGen Finance is a loan application assistance platform. Loan approval depends on eligibility checks and verification by
          the concerned financial institution or lender. We do not guarantee approval.

      <h2 class="section-title">Why customers trust NextGen Finance</h2>
      <p class="section-sub">

        <h2>A loan application should not feel complicated</h2>
        <p>
          We designed our application form to feel clear and easy. Every field is intentional. For example, PAN details help verification,
          employment status helps identify suitable options, and pincode ensures serviceability. Instead of asking customers to upload
          multiple documents at the first step, we start with a simple and structured form.
        </p>

        <h3>Support during the process</h3>
        <p>
          Many borrowers have questions: “How much can I get?”, “What’s the interest rate?”, “Will my credit score be affected?”,
          “What documents are needed?”. Our team helps answer these questions and guides customers through next steps
          after the application is received.
        </p>

        <h3>Focus on user experience</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mobile-first design to ensure easy form fill on phones</li>
          <li>Clear validation messages to reduce submission failures</li>
          <li>Fast submission with minimal steps</li>
          <li>Professional communication and clarity on next steps</li>
